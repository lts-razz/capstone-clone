# API Reference
> For frontend developers integrating with this backend.

## How to call an endpoint

All API routes return JSON. Always check `response.ok` first.

```js
const res  = await fetch('/api/bookings/CreateBookings', {
  method:  'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body:    JSON.stringify({ venueId, startDate, endDate }),
});
const data = await res.json();

if (!res.ok) {
  console.error(data.error); // always a plain string
  return;
}
// use data.bookingId, data.totalPrice, etc.
```

**Error shape** (all errors):
```json
{ "error": "Human-readable message" }
```

**Auth** is handled by HttpOnly cookies set at sign-in — you don't manage tokens.
For 401 responses, redirect the user to `/signin`.

## Auth

### `POST /api/auth/signin`
Sign in. Accepts `multipart/form-data` (HTML form POST).

| Field | Type | Required |
|-------|------|----------|

→ On success: sets cookies, **redirects** to `/dashboard`  
→ On failure: **redirects** to `/signin?error=<message>`

---

### `POST /api/auth/signup`
Register a new account. Accepts JSON.

```json
{
  "email":     "user@example.com",
  "password":  "min6chars",
  "firstName": "Juan",
  "lastName":  "dela Cruz"
}
```

| Status | Body |
|--------|------|
| 201 | `{ "message": "Account created successfully." }` |
| 400 | `{ "error": "..." }` |

---

### `GET /api/auth/signout`
Sign out. No body needed. Clears cookies, redirects to `/signin`.

---

## Bookings

Booking status values are `booked` (Booked), `rescheduled` (Rescheduled), `cancelled` (Cancelled), and `completed` (Completed). These are separate from payment statuses. New bookings use `booked`; unpaid reservation validity is tracked by payment and reservation fields rather than booking status.

Customers must make bookings at least 1 week in advance. Booking creation rejects check-in or event dates earlier than the minimum allowed date; admin rescheduling requires an explicit override for earlier dates.

### `POST /api/bookings/CreateBookings` 🔒
Create a booking. User must be logged in.

```json
{
  "venueId":         "uuid",
  "startDate":       "2026-07-14",
  "endDate":         "2026-07-16",
  "eventDate":       "2026-07-15",
  "eventType":       "Wedding",
  "packageId":       "uuid",
  "pax":             80,
  "fullName":        "Juan dela Cruz",
  "phone":           "+63 912 345 6789",
  "specialRequests": "Please set up floral arch"
}
```

Only `venueId`, `startDate`, `endDate` are required. All others optional.

| Status | Body |
|--------|------|
| 201 | `{ "bookingId": "uuid", "totalPrice": 55000, "reservationExpiresAt": "2026-07-27T12:00:00.000Z", "message": "..." }` |
| 400 | `{ "error": "validation message" }` |
| 401 | `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }` |
| 409 | `{ "error": "Venue is already booked for those dates" }` |

---

### `GET /api/bookings/GetUserBookings` 🔒

**Query params:**

| 401 | `{ "error": "Unauthorized" }` |

---

### `POST /api/bookings/CancelBookings` 🔒

```json
{ "bookingId": "uuid" }
```

---

### `POST /api/bookings/ConfirmBookings` 🔒 Admin

```json
{ "bookingId": "uuid" }
```

---

### `POST /api/admin/reschedule` 🔒 Admin

```json
{
  "bookingId":    "uuid",
  "newStartDate": "2026-08-01",
  "newEndDate":   "2026-08-03",
  "newEventDate": "2026-08-02"
}
```

| Status | Body |
|--------|------|
| 200 | `{ "message": "...", "newBookingId": "uuid" }` |

---

## Notifications

### `POST /api/notifications/send-weekly-reminders` Admin or cron secret
Send reminders for bookings whose event date is seven days away.

The endpoint respects each customer's email/SMS preferences. Successful email sends set `one_week_email_sent_at`; successful SMS sends set `one_week_sms_sent_at`. If one channel fails, only that channel remains null and is retried later. `one_week_notice_sent_at` is set after every enabled channel has been sent.

Pass `NOTIFICATION_CRON_SECRET` as a bearer token, `x-cron-secret`, or `?secret=` when configured; otherwise use an admin session.

---

## Reservation Validity

Every new unpaid booking receives a 48-hour reservation hold. On creation, `reservation_created_at` is set to the current time and `reservation_expires_at` is set to 48 hours later. `POST /api/bookings/CreateBookings` returns the latter as `reservationExpiresAt`, and customer booking views display it as the payment deadline.

The reservation timestamp fields on `bookings` are:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `reservation_created_at` | Start of the reservation hold |
| `reservation_expires_at` | End of the 48-hour unpaid hold |
| `expiration_reminder_sent_at` | Successful expiration-reminder delivery time; prevents repeat reminders |
| `reservation_expired_at` | Time the reservation was automatically expired |
| `expiration_cancel_notice_sent_at` | Successful automatic-cancellation notice delivery time |

### `POST /api/reservations/expire` Admin or cron secret

Process reservation reminders and expirations. Schedule this endpoint at least daily; a more frequent schedule cancels reservations closer to their exact deadline.

Before expiration, the endpoint sends one reminder to eligible active, unpaid reservations whose deadline is within the next 24 hours. It records `expiration_reminder_sent_at` only after successful notification delivery, so successful reminders are not resent and failed notifications can be retried.

At or after `reservation_expires_at`, an active unpaid reservation is changed to `cancelled`. The endpoint sets `cancelled_at` and `reservation_expired_at`, records a system cancellation reason/source, and sends an automatic-cancellation notice. Availability queries exclude `cancelled` bookings, releasing those dates. Paid and partially paid bookings are not expired.

Configure the server-only `RESERVATION_CRON_SECRET` and provide it through one of:

```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_SECRET
x-cron-secret: YOUR_SECRET
```

The endpoint also accepts `?secret=YOUR_SECRET`. If `RESERVATION_CRON_SECRET` is unset, it uses `NOTIFICATION_CRON_SECRET`; if neither exists, an authenticated admin session is required.

Example response:

```json
{
  "count": 1,
  "expiredReservations": 1,
  "bookingIds": ["uuid"],
  "remindersSent": ["uuid"],
  "cancellationNoticesSent": ["uuid"],
  "notificationFailures": []
}
```

### Reservation validity testing checklist

- [ ] A new unpaid booking gets `reservation_expires_at = now + 48 hours`.
- [ ] An unpaid booking shows its deadline to the customer.
- [ ] The expiration reminder sends only once.
- [ ] An expired unpaid booking becomes `cancelled`.
- [ ] A cancelled expired booking releases its dates for availability.
- [ ] Paid and partially paid bookings do not expire.
